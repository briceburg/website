                    h1 NashJs Code of Conduct

                    p NashJs is committed to a safe and positive environment. As such, we have adopted the following code of conduct standard, which is an adapted version of the PyCon code of conduct, located
                        a(href='https://us.pycon.org/2012/codeofconduct/')  here
                        .

                    p We value the participation of each member of the Nashville community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the meetup and at all events, whether officially sponsored by NashJs or not.

                    p To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at any NashJs event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event, on the IRC channel, and in the mailing list.

                    hr

                    h4 THE SHORT VERSION
                    p NashJs is dedicated to providing a harassment-free user group experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

                    p All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any group venue, the IRC channel, the mailing list, and presentations.

                    p Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for NashJs.

                    p Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the meetup/event without a refund (where applicable) at the sole discretion of the group organizers.

                    p Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly group for all.

                    hr

                    h4 THE LONGER VERSION
                    p Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

                    p Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

                    p Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for NashJs.

                    p If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the group organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup/event with no refund (where applicable).

                    p This applies to all channels of communications within the NashJS group, like the IRC channel, the mailing list, and events.
